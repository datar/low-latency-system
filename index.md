## Linux OS tuning

- [Redhat Linux Performance Tuning Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html-single/performance_tuning_guide/index)
**An essential manual of tuning Linux OS.** Concepts and tools are introduced in this article. It's a perfect entry of performance optimization. It works with RHEL and Centos. Other distributions may have different toolchains. But the concepts are similar. Please select the right version number for your system.

- [Low Latency Performance Tuning for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1323793) Based on concepts introduced in the article above, this article focuses on how to get low latency. To access this article needs a Red Hat account.

## System tuning guides from server vendors
Server vendors have their tuning guides. Generally, a tuning guide from a server vendor contains similar sections which are hardware tuning, OS tuning, network tuning, benchmark test, etc. In a hardware tuning section, there would be some options about turning on high performance mode on a server. Some subtle differences would be in OS tuning section.

## Tuning Guides from Intel and AMD

Few years ago, Intel Xeon CPU was the only choice for a low latency system. It provides enough cores, CPU frequency, cache capacity, etc. Overclocked dual 2600 series CPU was the mainstream solution. Some scenarios would choose a single 1600 series CPU for higher frequency. Xeon CPU has a problem. They only could be overclocked via the base clock. That means only 1 digit percentage of frequency increment. Core i5/i7 series CPU could provide a high overclocked ratio. But the core number was a problem until core i9 released. A top core i9 CPU like i9-7980XE has 18 cores with 4.2 GHz turbo frequency. Some vendors can make all cores running at 4.6+ GHz. A single socket solution removes the latency between CPUs. Servers based on i9 is a mainstream solution now. The same thing happened with AMD. AMD's EPYC CPU is another choice now.
